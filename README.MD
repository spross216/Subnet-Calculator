# Subnet Calculator
This is a Python-based subnet calculator that uses a GUI to take in user input and output subnet-related data. The application allows users to specify the desired network octet and the number of subnets. Based on this input, the program calculates the subnet mask, CIDR notation, network ID, IP address range, and broadcast ID. Finally, the output is saved to a CSV file.

## Prerequisites
